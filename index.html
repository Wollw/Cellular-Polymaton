		<p>
		In the summer of 2011 after playing around with cellular automata
		and their implementations I had the idea to start building
		some sculptures based on the concept.  In the fall of that year
		I signed up for the intermediate sculpture class at the local
		community college with an instructor I took a introductory class
		from a year or so prior. He was incredibly helpful both in teaching
		me how to use the tools needed to complete the pieces and by
		encouraging me to keep working when thing seemed hopeless
		<a href="http://www.superplexus.com/">
			and his work really deserves to be looked at too
		</a>.

		<p>
		I could make up all sorts of fluff about the meaning behind this
		project but really I just find cellular automata interesting and
		wanted to explore what happened when I took them off the regular
		square grid so commonly used.  The parts needed to build this were
		actually pretty basic (at its most basic it is pretty much just
		an ATtiny85V, some shift registers, and some LEDs) but I ended up
		designing a circuit board for the LEDs to allow for more control
		over how the lights change between states.  The boards I ended up
		using I designed in
		<a href="http://iut-tice.ujf-grenoble.fr/kicad/">KiCAD</a>
		and ordered through <a href="http://batchpcb.com/">BatchPCB</a>;
		the boards are simply ATtiny4 microcontrollers with three of their
		outputs hooked up to the legs of a 7.6mm² LED to allow for
		RGB output.  The schematics and code I'm using for these boards can
		be found <a href="https://github.com/Wollw/LED-PWM-Controller">here
		</a>.

		<p>
		The parts needed for the main board are quite simple:
		<ul>
			<li>(1) ATtiny85</li>
			<li>Some number of 74HC595 shift registers. Enough for all the
			desired outputs.</li>
		</ul>
		Of course you'll need a 5V power source capable of providing enough
		current and decoupling caps for all the ICs too.  Other than that
		it's just a matter of configuring the "config.h" file in this
		project's main repository.  There are a few examples in the
		"projects" directory in the repository and the readme explains how
		the configuration works in more detail than I am here.

		<p>
		In addition to the main board you'll probably want something doing
		something based on the state of each cell.  Each pin on the
		shift registers represents one cell's state; a high pin means
		"alive" and a low pin means "dead."  For this project I'm currently
		just using the LED controller boards I described earlier to fade
		between two colors based on the state.  The ATtiny4 has one pin
		attached to a shift register output and that handles the fading
		based on the pin state.  If you want to build some of these boards
		you'll need to order them from someplace like
		<a href="http://batchpcb.com">BatchPCB</a> and also get the parts
		needed.  As an example my Automaton 0x01 project uses Bivar
		Blue/Green LEDs with a 160° viewing angle and the part list for
		each board is as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>(1) ATtiny4 in SOT23_6 package</li>
			<li>(2) 68Ω resistors in 1206 package</l1>
			<li>(1) Bivar Blue/Green 160° viewing angle LED
			(Part Number R50BG2-F-0160)</li>
		</ul>
		Of course you'll need the board to put the parts on too and the
		ability to solder surface mount parts.

		<p>
		Once all the boards are built all that's left is to wire everything
		up.  The way I did it was to use a
		<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/276">
			5V 2A switching power supply</a>
		and wire the main board and all the controller boards to a that.
		I separated the controller boards into groups and daisy-chained the
		power and ground of each group together.  The grouping was to
		ensure that the LEDs didn't pull too much current through one wire.
		After all the power and ground connections were made I just
		connected each shift register pin to its corresponding LED
		controller board's input and it was ready to go (you'll want to
		flash the firmware for the microcontrollers if you haven't of
		course).
